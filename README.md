# [Obligatory Assignment 2: “Battleship”](https://retting.ii.uib.no/inf101.v19.sem2/blob/master/SEM-2.md)


* **README**
* [Assignment instructions](SEM-2.md)

This project contains [obligatory assignment 2](SEM-2.md). You can also [read the assignment instructions online](https://retting.ii.uib.no/inf101.v19.oppgaver/inf101.v19.sem2/blob/master/SEM-2.md) (may contain small updates that aren't in your local copy).

**Deadline:**
* The entire assignment has to be handed in by **Friday the 26th of April 23:59** 
* [Tips for a smooth(er) handin](https://retting.ii.uib.no/inf101/inf101.v19/wikis/innlevering)

**You have to indicate which parts of the assignment you've completed and if the assignment is ready for grading in the section below in your README.md.**

**Extension:** You can ask the teaching assistants for a deadline extension if needed. You should already have completed parts of the assignment and pushed these to the repository at before the deadline when asking for an extension.
   * A day or two extension is fine without motivation.
   * For longer extensions, we need a concrete reason for the delay. Please also contact us if there are [other things we need to consider](http://www.uib.no/student/49241/trenger-du-tilrettelegging-av-ditt-studiel%C3%B8p).
